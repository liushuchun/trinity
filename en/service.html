                        transaction is the valuation of assets/liabilities involved. It is normal business practice that
                        companies would determine the consideration by hiring a third-party appraiser or companies may
                        also obtain valuation review on reports issued by another appraiser. Furthermore, when
                        determining the price of certain assets for purposes of deal pricing and deal structuring,
                        companies need financial modelling support. The continuous development of PRC securities markets
                        and bond markets also bring about corresponding assets valuation needs and analysis of future

                              are required to be measured at fair value in the financial statements. Numerous variables
                              are involved in such valuation, and such valuation requires the use of complicated
                              mathematical model (such as Black-Scholes option pricing model, binomial option pricing
                              model, Monte Carlo simulation).</p>

                              China Generally Accepted Accounting Standard (CAS), fair values of biological assets are
                              required to be measured on each financial reporting date. Usually, fair values are
                              measured twice a year at the respective balance sheet date of interim report and annual
                              report, and re-assessed every year. Changes in fair value of biological assets will have a

                              transaction data, revenue target and replacement cost, and valuation of the subject mining
                              concession is conducted using cost method, market approach and income approach.</p>
